###First 40 Fires workshop held
We had a really good turn out - around 30 people, including engineers, IT experts, open source enthusiasts, lawyers and website designers. The event was chaired by [Patrick Andrews]. We started with a round of introductions, followed by a presentation by [Hugo Spowers], John Bevan and [Nicolas Sergent] of the car and the open source collaboration approach. We then had a question and answer session, firstly covering the technology and then opening out into a discussion about how the open source collaboration might work.
