!!%%(text-decoration:underline; color:grey; )7. Conclusions%%
\\
There is a large amount of information available concerning hydrogen as a fuel for vehicles. This report has attempted to draw together the available information and draw conclusions as to hydrogen safety in a fair, critical and transparent manner. 
\\
The main conclusions are as follows:
\\
 
\\
*	Hydrogen, like any other fuel, is safe if handled correctly. Safety systems should be implemented for both FCEVs and hydrogen filling stations.\\
*	Evidence suggests that hydrogen can be as safe as, if not safer than, gasoline. Hydrogen has been used extensively for other tasks and has displayed an excellent safety record.\\
*	Hydrogen storage onboard a vehicle is safer than gasoline storage due to the fact that air is not allowed into the hydrogen tank, meaning a combustible mix cannot develop.\\
*	The public image of hydrogen as a dangerous fuel is unfounded, and can be attributed to fear of the unknown, similar to when gasoline powered vehicles were first introduced in the 1800s.\\
