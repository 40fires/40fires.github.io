40 Fires is hosting the development of the  [Riversimple|http://www.riversimple.com] hydrogen fuel cell powered network electric car.

The long term aim is to make as much of the car open source as possible, consistent with having the best and most efficient car. Parts such as the fuel cell, the motors and the tyres are made by other manfacturers and are proprietary to them, but most mechanical hardware, electronic hardware and software will be made available.
